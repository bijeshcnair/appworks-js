# appworksJS

## What is appworksJS?

appworksJS is a javascript library for building feature rich, hybrid enterprise apps utilizing on device technology while leveraging the power of the OpenText EIM stack.

## Installation

#### With bower:

````shell
bower install --save appworks-js
````

You can find the production files in the `dist` directory.

#### Auto install:
If you are deploying an app to the gateway, the gateway will automatically add appworks.min.js to the root of your project. If you opt to use the bundled file make sure your script tag looks like this:

`<script src="appworks.min.js"></script>`

## Usage API and Examples

### Plugin
All plugins have the following type definition:

````ts   
abstract class AWPlugin {
    successHandler: () => void;
    errorHandler: () => void;
    /**
     * Base plugin class. Constructor takes in a success function and error function to be executed upon
     * return from call to native layer
     * @param successHandler - the function to be executed when the native call succeeds. passes an object as arg
     * @param errorHandler - the function to be executed when the native call fails. passes an object as arg.
     */
    constructor(successHandler: any, errorHandler: any) {
        this.successHandler = successHandler;
        this.errorHandler = errorHandler;
    }
}
````
This means that whenever creating a new Plugin object, you must initialize it with your success and error callbacks.
When the call to the native layer succeeds or fails, your handler will get executed. If you require a new callback
to be executed, create a new object. Plugin objects extend AWPlugin and are listed below, under the subcategory Plugin.

For example:

````js
var camera = new Appworks.AWCamera(onPluginSuccess, onPluginFail);

function onSuccess(data) {
    console.log(data);
    // do something with data
}

function onFail(err) {
    console.log(err);
}

camera.takePicture();
````


#### Auth
The Auth plugin allows you to seamlessly authenticate against your backend. Useful for refreshing tokens and gaining
access rights to make api calls against the gateway.

##### Methods:

````
authenticate()
````
Makes a call against the gateway /auth endpoint. Returns the response to the callback registered
upon creation of the instance

##### Example:

````js
var auth = new Appworks.Auth(
    function (data) {
        // got the response, now make backend api calls
        var response = data.data;
        $.ajax({
            method: 'POST',
            url: response.gatewayUrl + '/v1/content/nodes/1234/children',
            headers: { otcsticket: response.addtl.otcsticket },
            data: { foo: bar }
        });
    },
    function (err) {
        // could not complete authentication request
        console.log(err);
    }
);
    
$('#click-me').click(function () {
    auth.authenticate();
});
````

## Build
To build the compressed, minified appworks.js source and the uncompressed, commented code, open up your terminal at the appworksjs directory and type in the following commands

`npm install`

This will install of the dependencies required to build the library.

To build appworks-js

`grunt`

The final file can be found in `dist/appworks.min.js` and `dist/appworks.js`
